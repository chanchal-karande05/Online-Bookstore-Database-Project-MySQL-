# 📚 Online Bookstore SQL Project  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project simulates the database of an **Online Bookstore**. It includes schema design, table creation, and SQL queries for analyzing books, customers, and orders. The project demonstrates skills in **database design, data manipulation, and analytical SQL queries**.
